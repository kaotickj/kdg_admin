<h2>KDG ADMIN PHP Website Framework</h2>
<img src="/kdg-cms-admin.png" />
<p>PHP website framework. Requires PHP 7.4+ Some functions, such as the RSS Feed and Sitemap generators, require system specific configuration. GNU/GPL3 License. This is NOT a Content Management System. No code is provided for front end functionality. The current state is a mixture of procedural and object oriented programming that I have (slowly) been converting to OOP. It works well as-is, but will require that you inspect and understand the code, then modify it to your needs. </p>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>place the "kdg_admin" folder in your webroot directory. Import "kdg_admin.sql". Modify "db_credentials" and "config.php" with your database connection credentials. Login is: user: administrator password: P@ssword1234 After logging in, navigate to user management > add user (/admin/index.php?page=addUser) and create a new admin user account. Logout and login as the new user.  Navigate to user management > view users (/admin/index.php?page=viewUsers) and delete the default admin user (administrator).</p>
